# POE-Final-Project

### Minimum Viable Product
Our MVP is to a build an intelligent, battery powered four wheel vehicle with remote data acquisition capabilities and sensor informed driving characteristics. Some stretch goals of ours are to include an intelligent drive algorithm with variable torque delivery for our wheels, self driving capabilities, aerodynamic features, video recording ability, and real time data plotting. We aim to prioritize robust, informed design and reliability. 

This project is a work in progress, with an estimated completion date in early December. Stay tuned for more updates.
